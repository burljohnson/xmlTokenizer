# Introduction 
Tokenizer was built to help with the development of Sisense Elasticubes. This is only really needed at the moment for the Windows version of Sisense. We most likely do not need it for the Linux version. 

# Getting Started
1.	You will need to install Python 3 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2.	If pip isn't installed you will need to install pip. Simply run the following command in your terminal or command prompt
### Windows
```
 py -m ensurepip --upgrade
```
### Mac
```
### python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```
### Linux
```
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```
3. Install the path2 library
```
pip3 install pathlib2
```
4. Now you are ready to use Tokenizer!
